    "In this third project, you will do some analysis and optimizations in uCIR. First, you will determine the basic blocks. After, you're going to build a control flow graph (CFG) adding additional predecessor and successor information to nodes of the CFG.  Next, you're going to compute the dominators for the CFG, i.e. for each basic block, identify the set of basic blocks that dominate that block. This means that every path from the entry block to that block must go through the blocks in the dominator set. After that, you can simplify control flow (1) by merging consecutive blocks where the parent has one child, the child one parent, and both have compatible instruction leaders; (2) find all immediate dead blocks and remove then and finally, perform some basic optimizations like constant propagation, constant folding and dead code elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to give you a hand by giving you some of the pieces prewritten and littered your code with helpful statements. By the time you’re done, you’ll have a pretty thorough understanding of the analyses and optimizations realized by real compilers."

    "## Basic Block Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing the sequence of instructions in its intermediate representation for the program, we will determine the basic blocks. A basic block is a sequence of instructions where the control flow enters only at the beginning of the block and exits at the end of the block, without the possibility of deviation to any other part of the program. The basic blocks make up the nodes of a control flow graph (CFG), a structure that will be important for performing code optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the basic blocks, you must first determine the set of leaders, which will match the first statement of each basic block. To do this, proceed according to the algorithm below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first instruction is a leader;\n",
    "2. Any instruction that is subject to conditional or unconditional deviation is a leader;\n",
    "3. Any instruction that comes immediately after a conditional or unconditional deviation instruction is a leader;\n",
    "4. For each leader, your basic block consists of the leader and all instructions that follow him to the next leader, excluding this last.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building the basic blocks, you may note that the first statement of a basic block is always a label and the last statement is a jump statement (conditional or unconditional). Function calls should be treated as straight-line IR nodes (i.e., they are not treated as branches; their successor is the instruction immediately after the call). Return nodes do not have any successors.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Unconditional jumps (like at the end of for loops) have only one successor:\n",
    "the target of the jump statement. When you see an unconditional jump, add the target of the jump statement as a successor of the jump, and the jump statement as a predecessor of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Conditional jumps have two successors: the ```fall_through``` target, which can be a successor in the linked list, and the ```taken``` target. Add the branch as a predecessor of the taken target, and the taken target as an additional successor of the branch."

    "### Liveness Analysis\n",
    "Liveness analysis is a data flow analysis that finds what variables are live after any statement. It is an any-path, backward flow analysis. We will perform intra-procedural liveness analysis (i.e., we will compute liveness at the function granularity, but not across functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve built the CFG, liveness analysis is easy. Compute the GEN and KILL sets for each block. GEN represents all the temporaries and variables that are used in an instruction, and KILL represents all the temporaries and variables that are defined in an instruction. For most instructions, this should be pretty straightforward. A few tricky cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ```store_type``` this instruction use source (GEN) & define target (KILL) while ```store_type_*```use both source & target. The same for ```read_type```and ```read_type_*```. Note that this strategy means that you do not touch the ```alloc_type``` instructions. An extra pass can be made at final to remove unused allocs.\n",
    "  - ```call``` instructions require special care. Because we do not analyze liveness across functions, we must make conservative assumptions about what happens in function calls. In particular, we GEN all the temporaries in ```param_type```. The ```call``` itself kills the return var. The GEN set for any ```call``` instruction therefore contains all global variables, while the KILL set is their return var.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know the GEN and KILL sets for each CFG node, you can compute liveness. To do this, define IN (live-in) and OUT (live-out) sets for each CFG Node. Initialize the OUT sets for Exit nodes to all global variables (because global variables may be used after the function returns), and initialize all other sets to empty. Then compute the live-in and live-out sets for node as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The set of variables that are live out of a node is the union of all the variables that are live in to the node's successors.\n",
    "  - The set of variables that are live in to a node is the set of variables that are live out for the node, minus any variables that are killed by the node, plus any variables that are gen-ed by the node.\n",

    "Note that in these definitions are recursive: the live-out set of a node is defined in terms of the live-in sets of its successors, which are in turn defined in terms of the live-in sets of their successors, and so on. If there is a loop in the code, then the definition seems circular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick to computing liveness is to compute a fixpoint: assignments to each of the live-in and live-out sets so that if you try to compute any node's live-in or live-out set again, you'll get the same result you already have. To do this, we will use a worklist algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Put all of the IR nodes on the worklist\n",
    "  2. Pull an IR node off the worklist, and compute its live-out and live-in sets according to the definitions above.\n",
    "  3. If the live-in set of the node gets updated by the previous step, put all of the node's predecessors on the worklist (because they may need to update their live-out sets).\n",
    "  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the worklist is empty. The live-out sets of each node now represent a fixpoint."
