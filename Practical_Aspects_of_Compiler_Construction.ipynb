    "The goal of this task is to write a complete compiler for uC (micro C) Language, designed exclusively for this purpose. uC has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. You can implement it in Python, C++ or Java but is highly recommended to do it in Python. To accomplish this task we will have a wonderful combination of tools and code that make compilers so cool."

    "The first project requires you to implement a scanner, and a parser for the uC language, specified by [uC BNF Grammar](./uC_Grammar.ipynb) notebook. Study the specification of uC grammar carefully. To complete this first project, you will use the [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/), a Python version of the [lex/yacc](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/) toolset with same functionality but with a friendlier interface. For those who prefer to write the compiler in C++, you should use the lex/yacc toolset and for those who choose java, you guys can use [antlr](https://www.antlr.org/).

    "Once syntax trees are built, additional analysis and synthesis can be done by evaluating attributes and executing code fragments on tree nodes. We can also walk through the AST to generate a linear N-address code, delineated through basic blocks, analogously to LLVM IR. We call this intermediate machine code as uCIR. So, in this second project, you will perform semantic checks on your program, and turn the AST into uCIR. uCIR uses Single Static Assignment (SSA), and can promote stack allocated scalars to virtual registers and remove the load and store operations, allowing better optimizations since values propagate directly to their use sites.  The main thing that distinguishes SSA from a conventional three-address code is that all assignments in SSA are for distinguished name variables. Details about this project are in the [Second Step](./Second_step.ipynb) notebook."

    "In this third project, you will do some analysis and optimizations in uCIR. You're going to build a control flow graph (CFG) and compute the SSA graph, reflected through phi operations in the uCIR. Next, you're going to compute the dominators for the CFG, i.e. for each basic block, identify the set of basic blocks that dominate that block. This means that every path from the entry block to that block must go through the blocks in the dominator set. After that, you can simplify control flow (1) by merging consecutive blocks where the parent has one child, the child one parent, and both have compatible instruction leaders; (2) find all immediate dead blocks and remove then and finally, perform some basic optimizations like constant propagation and dead code elimination.\n",

Before you start, carefully study this simplified specification of the LLVM-IR, tailored to our needs, to familiarize yourself with data structures, addressing modes, and the instructions.
