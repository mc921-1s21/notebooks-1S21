    "Once syntax trees are built, additional analysis and synthesis can be done by evaluating attributes and executing code fragments on tree nodes. We can also walk through the AST to generate a linear N-address code, analogously to LLVM IR. We call this intermediate machine code as uCIR. So, in this second project, you will perform semantic checks on your program, and turn the AST into uCIR. uCIR uses Single Static Assignment (SSA), and can promote stack allocated scalars to virtual registers and remove the load and store operations, allowing better optimizations since values propagate directly to their use sites.  The main thing that distinguishes SSA from a conventional three-address code is that all assignments in SSA are for distinguished name variables."

    "You can define a memory model that consists of a program memory (the code), a dictionary to hold references (indexes) to vars, labels & registers in the memory (M). All the data areas of M are divided into cells, and each cell can hold a single value. The actual size of a cell must be large enough to hold single values (int, char, bool and ref) or any element of string (chars) and arrays. For simplicity, you can use a separate dictionary to hold the indexes of globals vars and constants. These vars & constants will be previously stored at begining of the memory by the interpreter before start running the program.\n",
